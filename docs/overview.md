This task searches a source folder for CSV files contained within sub-folders. Each CSV files in each sub-folder will be converted to JSON and combined into one file. 

This task was build specifically for converting localization files. Our translation team preferred to work in Excel and manually converting those files into JSON was not only time-consuming, but also prone to error. This task automates a job that no one wanted and results in less time being spent on localization efforts.
