innovation,name,date,copy
weather,All Conditions,since 1980,"Taking on rain, snow, dirt and all terrains, Nike has constantly experimented with innovations that keep performing, whatever the weather. Waterproof linings and tougher suedes evolved into sealed seams and rugged synthetics — now technologies can provide All Conditions Control."
dynamic,Dynamic-Fit,since 1987,"If the shoe fits, the potential is infinite, but without a sense of movement it can be constrictive. Dynamic-Fit technology has hugged the ankles, strapped wearers in for a kinetic sense of security and operated inside those iconic uppers. It's still evolving."
material,Material,since 1977,"Leather might have been the only option back in the day, but Nike has strived to create fabrics and construction methods that can complement and often outperform natural materials. Nylons and lightweight meshes set a standard and the Football category redefined synthetics in 1998 — now hybrid blends and brand-new breakthroughs are key to precision builds for pure performance."
lightweight,Lightweight,since 1973,"Every gram is the difference between winning and losing. Over distance or the duration of a game it can make even more of an impact. It's not just about lightweight — it's about the right weight. Nike's earliest experiments with new fabrics evolved into builds that ditch stitches and extra panels. Those breakthroughs led to one-piece uppers and shoes made for single races, because excess is the archenemy here."
cushioning,Cushioning,since 1979,"The human body needs to be protected from itself — the impact inflicted during a run, a game, or even a walk, can be substantial. Dual density soles date back to Nike's earliest days, leading to an obsession with walking on air. From those preoccupations to today's reactive, responsive foams, comfort is a quest. Finding that perfect balance between feel and protection has always been part of the process."
football,Football,since 1971,"The first shoe with a Swoosh was made for football. Over the decades, Nike Football has been the training ground for an array of innovations in material, fit and feel to channel control, speed, touch and power into perfect play. Those technologies have been the catalyst for some of the most significant performance breakthroughs of the last decade across other categories too."
flyknit,Flyknit,since 2012,"As an extension of Nike's experiments into material innovation, Nike Flyknit altered nearly every aspect of manufacture, shape and design. Beyond running and training, even pitch and court performance got knitted for extra precision. Impossibly light but incredibly strong, this is just a preview of footwear's future."
natural,Natural Motion,since 1971,"It turns out that freeing the foot would bring benefits. For years, shoe design often operated around feet without integrating what nature provided, but natural motion lets the body move as it was born to do. Tested time and time again, this sense of pure movement would influence almost every Nike category beyond running and training, becoming best practice within basketball, golf, football and skateboarding."
color,Colour,since 1972,"Sometimes you need to shout to get an audience's full attention. Colour has played a role in making a statement, from track meets to history made at a global level. It's been key in ensuring designs resonate a little louder than the opposition, but visibility and optical illusions even have the potential to perform: highlighting and disguising a player's feet on game day."
